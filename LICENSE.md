DISTRIBUTION: This character can be freely distributed as long as it's NOT sold for profit AND that the original files are still intact.

COPYING/MODIFICATIONS: This character includes a basic form of copy protection designed to prevent any gameplay if an unauthorized copy is detected. So if you want to make public modifications or use this character as a base of your own, it is a necessity that you ask me permission FIRST regardless of ANYTHING. Failure to do so will bar you from acquiring my permission at all. I will NOT hesitate to take action against ANYONE who is caught copying this character WITHOUT prior permission.

USE OF CONTENTS: I welcome any use of the contents provided in this character for another project of your own as long as you ask me permission FIRST AND give proper credit. The only notable exception is if, and ONLY if, it's for your own personal use.
